## Architecture

/game
    engine.go        # Core poker logic
    model.go         # Player, Table, Deck, Actions
    handeval.go      # Hand strength evaluator

/ws
    hub.go           # WebSocket hub
    handlers.go      # Message routing

/cmd
    server.go        # Server entrypoint

{ "type": "join" }

Action:
{ "type": "action", "action": "call" }

Raise:
{
  "type": "action",
  "action": "raise",
  "amount": 120
}

### Server → Client

State:

  "hand": 2,
  "phase": "TURN",
  "pot": 540
}

Error:
{
  "type": "error",

## Python Player Client

import asyncio
import json
import websockets

API_KEY = "dev"
TABLE = "table-1"
PLAYER = "p1"

async def player():
    url = f"ws://localhost:8080/ws?apiKey={API_KEY}&table={TABLE}&player={PLAYER}"
    async with websockets.connect(url) as ws:
        await ws.send(json.dumps({ "type": "join" }))
        print(f"Joined as {PLAYER}")
        while True:
            msg = await ws.recv()
            print(msg)

asyncio.run(player())


## Running the Server

docker build -t poker-ws .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e API_KEY=dev poker-ws
